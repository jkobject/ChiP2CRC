I've picked 5 PDXs - 30-34 and had the appropriate controls

Samples are

CHIPs (PDXxx for PDX numbers):

45-mp438-PDX30-H3K27ac-r1_S6

46-mp439-PDX30-H3K27ac-r2_S7

47-mp440-PDX31-H3K27ac-r1_S8

48-mp441-PDX31-H3K27ac-r2_S1

49-mp442-PDX32-H3K27ac-r1_S2

50-mp443-PDX32-H3K27ac-r2_S3

51-mp444-PDX33-H3K27ac-r1_S4

52-mp445-PDX33-H3K27ac-r2_S5

53-mp456-PDX34-H3K27ac-r1_S6

54-mp457-PDX34-H3K27ac-r2_S7
54-mp457-PDX34-H3K27ac-r2_S7_R1.fastq
 

Inputs (first two digits are PDX numbers):

31_MP5835_S5

33_MP5835_S7

34_MP5835_S8

Would you be able to organize a download of fastq files for about 5 PDX samples (H3K27ac, with 2 replicates that should be 10 samples), as well as the corresponding inputs, so maybe 15 files in total  

Jeremie - I would start by peak calling using MACS2.0 and then use ROSE for super enhancer stitching and ranking. LMK if questions.
